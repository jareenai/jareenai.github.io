Hi, my name is Jareen Imam. I am a creative writer and journalist based out of Atlanta. I have more than five years of professional writing, producing and marketing experience for companies like CBS, CNN and [CNN.com](http://cnn.com).

Currently, I am working as a producer with the award-winning CNN iReport team. When I am not working, I am usually writing essays for my humor and lifestyle blog, [ChalkLine Productions](http://chalklineproductions.blogspot.com/). 

I graduated from Emory University, with a BA in creative writing and English, and a co-major in journalism. I have a background in illustrations and graphic design. While at Emory, I worked on several University student-run publications. I was a staff writer for Emory's student-run newspaper the Wheel, and rose to the ranks of managing editor for Emory's Political Review magazine, while also maintaining a two year editorial position at Emory's humor magazine.
