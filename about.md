Hi, I'm Jareen. I'm a creative writer and journalist based out of Atlanta. I have more than five years of professional writing, producing and marketing experience for companies like CBS, CNN and [CNN.com](http://cnn.com).

Currently, I'm a part of CNN's social department where I write and produce for the award-winning [CNN iReport team](http://ireport.cnn.com/blogs/ireport-blog/2012/03/09/team-ireport-grows-again-welcome-jareen-imam). I have a background in illustration work and graphic design as well. On my free time, I write essays for my humor and lifestyle blog, [ChalkLine Productions](http://chalklineproductions.blogspot.com/). 

In 2011, I graduated from Emory University with a Bachelors of Arts in creative writing, English, and a co-major in journalism. While at Emory, I worked for several student-run publications. I was a staff writer for Emory's newspaper the Wheel, a managing editor for Emory's Political Review magazine, and also an editor for Emory's humor magazine.
